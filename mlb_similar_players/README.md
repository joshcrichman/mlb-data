This app finds the 5 most similar players (offensive stats only), within the same position and overall, to every player in the 2017 season.  Standard metrics are used, and each can be weighted individually within the script to vary their contribution to similarity.  Similarity is calculated by finding the normalized differences between Player A and Player B in each metric, weighting the metric scores as specified, and then summing across all weighted scores.  The default weight is 1 for all metrics.  

The current data used was pulled from https://www.rotowire.com/baseball/player_stats.htm.  Unfortunately, there are multiple lines for single players that played on different teams in 2017.  This definitely impacts a small portion of the results, but I have not yet taken the time to collapse the individual data.  As long as input data is structured in the same format as the CSV included here, you can add any player data you wish.  At the moment, the metrics used are not dynamic so as to make weighting easier, so all columns found in the current CSV must be included in any new input file.

The Euclidian distance formula used in the script was taken from https://multimedia-pattern-recognition.info/fileadmin/Websites/mmprec/uploads/docs/Bauckhage/np-sp-rec-edm.pdf, method 4.  In concurrence with the author, it was found to be substantially faster as matrix size increased than other methods.
